WoolyUIKit
==========

Extensions and add-on classes for iOS UIKit

This is definitely "work in progress", has minimal documentation, and could be considered
quite sparse.

Best if used in conjunction with WoolyFoundation, but not required.

Installation
------------
1. Add WoolyUI.xcodeproj to your current project.
2. Add "WoolyUI.h" to your prefix file.
3. Update project [User] Header Search Paths and target dependencies appropriately.
